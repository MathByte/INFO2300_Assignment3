# 2048 puzzle game



 # ABOUT
 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game that was created by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. The game is played on a 5x5 grid, where the goal is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.


 # Game Play
 To play the game, you use the arrow keys to move the tiles in the grid. Each time you make a move, a new tile with the value of either 2 or 4 appears in a random empty spot on the board. When two tiles with the same value are moved together, they merge into a tile with double the value.

  # How to win?
  The game ends when there are no more moves to make, either because the board is completely filled with tiles or because there are no adjacent tiles with the same value. If you manage to create a tile with the value of 2048, you win the game.
